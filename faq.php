         <span class="faq-title">Why should I become a member?</span>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>The main reason to become a member is to be able to take all the monthly classes for no charge. If you've ever taken 
          Dance classes at a studio, you should realized that having free classes is a great bargain for the minium price of membership. 
          Members also often receive reduced prices for dinner dances. We are a very social group, so another great reason to join is to 
          meet new friends!

        <p>Simply print the form below and send it in along with dues to the treasurer. Their address is on the form. After they receive the form and enter your information, you'll be a member!

        <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Yes! We are doing our best to facilitate DOWOPS (as we now call them - Dancers Originally without Partners). We are setting aside special tables at dances to make it easy for singles to 
          dance with each other, and for other members to dance with them. We also try to make sure they have people to dance with at classes.

        <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Dances are events that are simply dances with a no host bar in the MountainView Ballroom. 
          Doors normally open at 6pm and the Dance ends at 8pm. We ask that you register by emailing countmein@sbballroomdance.com or registering on the website 
          so we can have the ballroom staff set up the right number of tables.

      <span class="faq-title">What Are Dinner Dance Events?</span>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Dinner Dances are events that provide a plated dinner in the MountainView Ballroom followed by a dance. There is a no host bar available as well. 
          Doors normally open at 5pm followed by the meal at 5:30pm. Unlike Dine and Dance, attending the dance portion alone is not allowed unless you've paid for the dinner. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be a form with a selection of meals and prices prior to the dance. 
          The form with meal selections and appropriate payment must be filled in and sent to Treasurer prior to the deadline.

        <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Dine and Dance events provide the option of dining with the group (normally in a private room) off the regular menu in the MountainView Grill at 4:30pm. Then a Dance is held in the MountainView
          ballroom at 6pm. The dance features a no host bar. We ask that when you register, you let us know if you are planning to attend dinner and the dance, or just the dance so we can give correct headcount
          numbers to the restaurant and the ballroom staff.

        <p>Dance Parties are dances where food may or may not be served. The food will be served prior to the dance usually at 4:30pm.
          The dance will normally start at 6pm once the food is cleared if food was served. 
        </p>
        <p>There may be a cost involved
          and if there is, it will be indicated on the event. Normally if payment is required for the event, a form will be associated with the event that will be submitted
          to the treasurer with the check. The treasurer's address will be indicated on the form.
        </p>
        <p>We will need to know if you plan to partake of the meal, or just attend the dance so that the correct number of tables can be set up in the ballroom.

        <p> We try to have a DJ at most of them - especially Fridays and Sundays, so that you can practice what you've been learning in the various classes. You can request music for various dances, and
          the DJs will play them if they have the music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often on Tuesdays when no Novice Class is being held, the room will be available without a DJ, so you could feel free to bring your own music and practice.
        </p>
        <p>They are designated as <em><strong>Open</strong></em> because they are open to all SaddleBrooke Residents.</p>
