        <p>If you love all kinds of dancing, we're the club for you. </p>
        <p> We don't just do Ballroom dance - at our dances/practices, we play 
            music for Ballroom Dance, Western and Western Partner Dance, Line Dance, and Latin Dances.</p>
       <br><strong> <p> We will help you get started if you've never stepped foot on the dance floor. We now are featuring Novice classes twice 
            a month, with a Novice Review Session once a month to help you feel more comfortable about joining dinner dances and other events.
            The Novice classes and the Novice Review Sessions are on Wednesdays in the Mariposa room in the same time slots as our open practice.

            countmein@sbballroomdance.com</a> for
            more information.</p></strong>

        <br><p>Our members can go to any class we provide free. Prospective members may attend one class free to see if they like it. </p>
        <p>Our members also receive reduced rates for our dinner dances, but you may attend as a guest
            if you'd like to get a feel for the club before committing. </p><br>
        <p>We also have several times during the week
            available for practice - some with D.J.s, sometimes you can bring your favorite music. These
            sessions designated as "Open Practice" are not restricted to members. </p>
            <p><em>Always check the Activites Calendar because we do have 
            cancellations.. and also for DJ information.</em> </p>
